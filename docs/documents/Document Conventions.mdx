# Documentation Conventions

## 7.1 Code Formatting

The code snippet follows specific formatting conventions to maintain consistency and readability:

- **Indentation**: Tabs are used for indentation throughout the codebase.
- **Line Length**: Lines of code are kept within a reasonable length to enhance readability.
- **Braces**: The "Allman style" brace formatting is used consistently for defining blocks of code.
- **Whitespace**: Appropriate whitespace is used to improve code clarity, including spacing between operators, keywords, and operands.
- **Comments**: Descriptive comments are included to provide context and explanations for complex or non-obvious code segments.

## 7.2 Naming Conventions

Naming conventions are carefully followed to ensure clarity and consistency across variables, functions, and other entities:

- **Variables**: Meaningful and descriptive names are used for variables, adhering to camelCase naming convention.
- **Functions**: Descriptive function names are employed, following camelCase convention and using verbs or action words to indicate function behavior.
- **Endpoints**: Clear and descriptive names are chosen for API endpoints, utilizing lowercase letters and hyphens for word separation.
- **Constants**: Uppercase letters and underscores are used for constants to distinguish them from variables.
- **Classes and Objects**: PascalCase convention is followed for class and object names, with class names representing nouns or noun phrases.

## 7.3 Versioning Scheme

The project follows a specific versioning scheme to track changes effectively:
- **Documentation Versioning**: Project documentation version is synchronized with the codebase version, ensuring consistency and easy reference.
