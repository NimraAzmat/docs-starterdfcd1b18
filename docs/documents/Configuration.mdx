## Configuration
### 4.1 OrbitDB Setup
OrbitDB is a distributed peer-to-peer database built on top of IPFS, enabling secure, decentralized, and resilient data storage. In this guide, we'll walk through setting up OrbitDB for a user authentication system using the provided code snippet.
Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:
- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Access to IPFS node or use a public IPFS gateway.
##### Project Structure

Create the following project structure:

```lua
orbitdb-authentication/
  |-- users-data database/json
  |-- auth-tokens database/json
  |-- src/
      |-- server.js
```

### 4.2 OrbitDB Configuration
OrbitDB is a decentralized database built on top of IPFS, providing a distributed and peer-to-peer method for storing and querying data. Configuring OrbitDB involves setting up various settings and options to customize its behavior. Here are some aspects of OrbitDB configuration:

#### Database Path: 
Specify the path where OrbitDB will store its database files. This path should be accessible and writable by your application.

#### Replication Options: 
Configure replication options to determine how data is replicated and distributed across the network. Replication options may include settings such as the number of peers to replicate data to, replication frequency, and replication strategy.

#### Access Control: 
Define access control rules to restrict or grant access to the database. Access control settings may include authentication mechanisms, permissions, and encryption to ensure data security and privacy.

#### Database Schema: 
Design the schema of your OrbitDB database, including the structure of documents, fields, and data types. Define how data is organized and indexed within the database to optimize querying and retrieval operations
