## 7. Security
### 7.1 API Key Management:
- Description: 
    The application manages API keys for accessing protected routes and resources.
- Implementation:
     - API keys are generated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization.
     - Access to sensitive endpoints is controlled using middleware functions that validate JWT tokens.
     - API keys are securely stored as environment variables using the dotenv package.

### 7.2 Data Encryption:
- Description: 
    The application ensures data confidentiality through encryption.
- Implementation:
    - User passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt library before storing them in the database.
    - Sensitive information exchanged between the client and server, such as JWT tokens, is encrypted using HTTPS protocol.
    - Communication between the server and the OrbitDB instance is encrypted to prevent data interception.

### 7.3 Access Control:
- Description: 
    The application enforces access control measures to restrict unauthorized access to resources.
- Implementation:
    - Middleware functions, such as authenticateToken, verify the authenticity of JWT tokens before granting access to protected routes.
    - Different levels of access are assigned based on user roles, and specific permissions are required to perform certain actions.
    - Error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 401, 403) are sent for unauthorized access attempts.
